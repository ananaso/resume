\textbf{Low Cost Fundus Camera} -- Senior Design\\
Created low-cost design for a functional modern fundus camera capable of capturing screening quality images of the retina. Interfaced Raspberry Pi with linear actuators, motor HAT, and controllable LEDs. Designed user interface in PyQt.\\\\
\textbf{Semi-autonomous Cell Battery Constructor}\\
Designed and implemented operations for FANUC R-30iB to construct experimental cell batteries based on design parameters input by the user, as well as carrying pallets of materials into and out of airlocks.\\\\
\textbf{USAF Ribbon Rack Visualizer} -- Personal Project\\
Developed PyQt application for visualizing ribbon racks with proper order of precedence. Designed with option to further extend support to other branches of the military.\\\\
\textbf{Genesee River Raft} -- Personal Project\\
Constructed raft by hand from fallen timber and successfully floated it from RIT to the University of Rochester boathouse.
